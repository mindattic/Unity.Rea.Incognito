#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Rebuilds Unity.Rea.Incognito (tools\build.ps1: the Windows player) only when Assets/Packages/ProjectSettings changed since the last deploy, and
    publishes a standalone copy to C:\Apps\Unity.Rea.Incognito\ -- same process Unity.SpaceGod and
    Unity.GridGame use to always have a fresh, independent deployed copy instead of a possibly-stale
    one.

.DESCRIPTION
    1. Pulls latest (skipped if the worktree has uncommitted changes, or the pull fails).
    2. Skips the rebuild if nothing under Assets/Packages/ProjectSettings changed since the last
       deploy at this commit (unless -Force).
    3. Stops any running Incognito.exe process (dev copy or deployed copy).
    4. Clears Builds\Windows -- the build OUTPUT only, never Library\ -- so the build below is
       never a stale incremental copy.
    5. Runs tools\build.ps1 (Unity batch mode; requires the Editor closed) -> Builds\Windows\Incognito.exe.
       Its own Unity run captures Logs\build-player.log.
    6. Copies Builds\Windows\* -> C:\Apps\Unity.Rea.Incognito\, refreshes the Desktop shortcut, and
       optionally launches it.

.PARAMETER Launch
    After publishing, immediately run the deployed Incognito.exe.

.PARAMETER Force
    Rebuild and republish even when no player source changed since the last deploy (skips only
    the up-to-date check; Library\ and user settings are untouched).

.NOTES
    This script never prompts, so agents and /deploy can run it unattended. The repo-root
    run.bat (the Desktop shortcut's target) is the interactive entry point: it asks
    1) Deploy & Run (this script with -Force -Launch) or 2) Run (starts the copy already in
    C:\Apps\Unity.Rea.Incognito without calling this script, deploying first if none is there).

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run.ps1
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run.ps1 -Launch
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run.ps1 -Force -Launch
